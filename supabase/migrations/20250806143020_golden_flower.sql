/*
  # Comprehensive Security Policies for CogniFlow

  1. Security Overview
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Create role-based access policies
    - Implement data isolation between therapists
    - Protect client data with strict access controls
    - Audit trail and compliance features

  2. Access Patterns
    - Therapists can only access their own clients and data
    - Clients can only access their own data
    - No cross-therapist data access
    - Admin functions for system management

  3. Security Features
    - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
    - JWT-based authentication
    - Role-based authorization
    - Data encryption at rest
    - Audit logging
