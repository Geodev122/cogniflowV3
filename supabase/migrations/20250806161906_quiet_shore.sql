/*
  # Create safe profile fetching function

  1. New Functions
    - `get_user_profile_safe` - Bypasses RLS to safely fetch user profiles
    - Uses SECURITY DEFINER to run with elevated privileges
    - Includes proper access controls within the function

  2. Security
    - Function runs as superuser to bypass problematic RLS
    - Internal checks ensure users can only access their own data
    - Therapists can access client data through relations table
